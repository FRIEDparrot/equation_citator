## Introduction & Simple Examples
Obsidian-Equation-Citator is a plugin that provides a simple and elegant way to write in-line equation citation cite equations in obsidian just like `\ref{}` label in latex.

Here is a simple examples to show how it works.
```
$$ E = mc^2 \tag{A} $$

This is an equation $\ref{eq:A}$.
```

this will be rendered as follows (support both light and dark theme) :

- Why this plugin?
  - While the existing plugin [Math Booster](<https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/math-booster>) (or `LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer` now) also provides equation citation in obsidian (since it's based on latex, it can't do cross-file citation and outline-based equation autonumber). Equation citator is focused on providing an **easy-to-use, light-weight but more powerful, elegant, and full customizable citation experience**. 

- This plugin would be very helpful if you : 
  - have habit of adding `\tag{}` in equation blocks, and want to have a elegant and powerful way to cite them. 
  - don't want to add ugly block reference `^` in your equation blocks for reference, and make your citation more organized and clean. 

## Main Features
1.  üöÄ **Easy Citation, Preview and Rename Tags**

Use simple inline `$\ref{eq:A}$` format to cite equation block with `\tag{A}` and preview it just as links in obsidian.  

Ctrl + hover to preview the equation of following tag (just hover when in reading mode). 

**Select tag (`\tag{1.2}`) and right click to edit tag**, and its **citation will be automatically updated**.

2.  üîó**Cross-file citation, Multi/Consecutive citation and easy jump**

Support cross-file citation **by footnote format**. Citing several equations by delimiter `,` is also supported. 

Consecutive citations will be automatically recognized and rendered in simple format for concise purpose, and you can also use consecutive format (`~`) to cite multiple equations. 

```sh
# for example
$\ref{eq:1^1.3.1~3, 1^2.1.1~2}$
# the above citation is same as the below :  
$\ref{eq:1^1.1.1, 1^1.1.2, 1^1.1.3, 1^2.1.1, 1^2.1.2}$  
# the above will be automatically combined together as continuous citation. 
```

This will render multiple equations in a window, and **you can use double click on an equation to jump here, or ctrl + double click to open on the right and jump** :

3.  ‚úàÔ∏è **Auto complete citations**

When you are typing citation format, The plugin will suggest you the available equations and citation format and fill in the equation number as you click. Which is shown in the following picture :

4.  ‚ö°**One-click outline-based Equation AutoNumber**

This plugin gives you full control of auto number method for equations.

Customize auto-number method (absolute or relative, title level, format, chapter prefix and more). 

You can auto number all the equations in your current file by command or just simply one click on the sidebar icon :

5.  üìú**PDF export support** 

Original PDF export in obsidian can fail to render citation, so a command is provided to make markdown for export to pdf correctly.  




## Write Guidelines
This plugin relies on text parsing, so please follow these three very simple guidelines to ensure it works correctly.

1. **Always write code blocks with 3 backticks** (```) without space before at the beginning and end of the equation block. 

2. **Never write any other content in the line of equation blocks** (but it support quote block).

3. Avoid using `\}` in your tag or citation (this will cause the tag recognized incorrectly) 




## Bugs & Suggestions

Since it's a new plugin, some bugs or issues may still exist. If you encounter any, please provide the following information on the issue page (if this is a feature coming soon, please not comment on the issue page, but wait for the release update) : 

1.  A description of the bug or issue, along with steps to reproduce it.
2.  The relevant markdown text that triggers the issue.  
3.  Enable debug mode in the settings tab, and provide the console log (Ctrl + Shift + I in Obsidian).
